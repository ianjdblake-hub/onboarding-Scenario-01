                <h2>Your Challenge</h2>
                <p><strong>You are Alex Rivera</strong>, Senior Director of Product Development at Meridian Corporation (5,000 employees). You've just hired <strong>Jamie Patterson</strong> as a Product Manager.</p>
                
                <p>Jamie has strong skills but comes from a smaller company. Meridian's matrix organization and relationship-driven culture are new territory. New hires often struggle not from lack of ability, but from failing to build the right networks.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Your challenge:</strong> Balance giving Jamie autonomy (valued by company culture) versus providing structure to prevent costly mistakes. Your leadership effectiveness will be judged on how quickly Jamie becomes productive.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>You'll make 5 key decisions over 90 days. Each choice has real consequences. There's no single "right" answer.</strong></p>

                    <p>End of Jamie's first week. HR onboarding is complete. Your peer Marcus (Engineering) warns: "Make sure your new PM understands our culture first. The last outside PM burned bridges."</p>
                    <p>Your manager Patricia says: "Don't over-coddle them. People who succeed here are self-starters."</p>
                    <p>You have urgent deadlines. Jamie seems engaged but tentative. You meet in 30 minutes to discuss their plan.</p>

                    <p>3) Annual planning starts in 2 weeks. Each PM presents strategy to VPs. Jamie's area (developer tools) hasn't had a PM for 2 months.</p>
